History
-------

0.1.48 (2015-07-15)
-------------------

* Add DeclinedReason resource

0.1.47 (2015-07-08)
-------------------

* Fixed a bug in ``APIRequestor.get``. Requesting a resource with with an id of ``0`` won't raise an Exception anymore.

0.1.46 (2015-06-10)
-------------------

* Added ``associated_services`` and ``original_departure_service`` to various service resources and ``departure_services`` model respectively.

0.1.45 (2015-05-27)
-------------------

* Fixed ``products`` within the ``Promotion`` resource to properly retain ``type`` and ``sub_type`` fields after being parsed into a dictionary.

0.1.44 (2015-05-22)
-------------------

* Changed default `cache_backend` to use `gapipy.cache.NullCache`. Previously, `SimpleCache` was the default and led to confusion in production environments, specifically as to why resources were not matching the API output. Now, by default, to get any caching from gapipy you must explicitly set it.

0.1.43 (2015-04-29)
-------------------

* Fixed `Place` init with empty admin_divisions


0.1.42 (2015-04-29)
-------------------

* Added `description` to `TourCategory` resource.

0.1.41 (2015-04-14)
-------------------

* Added `DepartureComponent` resource. See the [official G API documentation for details](https://developers.gadventures.com/docs/departure_component.html)

0.1.40 (2015-04-06)
-------------------

* Added `deposit` to `DepartureService` model

0.1.39 (2015-03-31)
-------------------

* Refactor ``APIRequestor._request``. While this should not change existing functionality, it is now possible to override specific methods on ``APIRequestor`` if needed.


0.1.38 (2015-03-23)
-------------------

* Fixed: Due to inconsistencies in the G API with regards to nested resources, the `fetch` function was modified to use the raw data from the API, rather than a specific set of allowed fields.

0.1.37 (2015-03-23)
-------------------

* Fixed: Iterating over ``products`` within the ``promotions`` object now works as expected. Previously, accessing the ``products`` attribute would result in a Query object with incorrect parameters.

0.1.36 (2015-03-17)
-------------------

* Support free to amount price range formatting (e.g. Free-10CAD)

0.1.35 (2015-03-12)
-------------------

* Added `duration_min` & `duration_max` to `ActivityDossier` model

  to `ActivityDossier`

0.1.19 (2014-11-17)
