History
=======

2.28.0 (2020-11-23)
-------------------

* Add a new ``Client`` config option, ``global_http_headers``, a dict of HTTP
  headers to add to each request made with that client.

  This is similar to the ``headers=`` kwargs available when making ``get`` and
  ``create`` calls, except that the ``global_http_headers`` set on a client will
  apply on *every request* made by that client instance.


2.27.0 (2020-05-26)
-------------------

* Make ``Customer.nationality`` a *resource field*. This allows attribute style
  access to the field values, whereas before they needed to be accessed using
  ``dict`` style syntax.

  .. code-block:: python

    # before
    >>> api.customers.get(123456).nationality["name"]
    u'Canadian'

    # now
    >>> api.customers.get(123456).nationality.name
    u'Canadian'


2.26.4 (2020-04-28)
-------------------

* Fix 2.26.3: include ``CONTRIBUTING.rst`` in the manifest.
  * This was broken when attempting to install ``gapipy`` using ``pip``


2.26.3 (2020-04-28) (Yanked)
----------------------------

* Fix py2 & py3 compatibility for ``urlparse``


2.26.2 (2020-04-20)
-------------------

* Fix for `2.26.1 (2020-04-20)`_ and `Issue #113`_.
  * See `PR 125 <https://github.com/gadventures/gapipy/pull/125>`_
  * Remove the ``_set_resource_collection_field`` method in ``TourDossier``
  * Introducing the ``_Parent`` namedtuple in `PR 123 <https://github.com/gadventures/gapipy/pull/123>`_
  broke being able to Query-chain from Tour-Dossiers to departures
  * Buggy behaviour from ``2.26.1`` below:

  .. code-block:: python

    >>> from gapipy import Client
    >>> api = Client(application_key='MY_SECRET_KEY')

    >>> api.tour_dossiers(24309).departures.count()
    # AttributeError: 'tuple' object has no attribute 'uri'


2.26.1 (2020-04-20)
-------------------

* Fix for `2.26.0 (2020-04-14)`_ and `Issue #113`_.
  * Calls to ``APIRequestor.list_raw`` will use initialised its parameters,
  unless the URI provides its own.
  * See `PR 123 <https://github.com/gadventures/gapipy/pull/123>`_.
* Add the ability to define the ``max_retries`` values on the requestor.
  * New ``env`` value ``GAPI_CLIENT_MAX_RETRIES``.
  * The default value will be ``0``, and if provided will override the ``retry``
  value on the ``requests.Session``.
  * This change will also always initialize a ``requests.Session`` value on
  initialisation of the ``gapipy.Client``.
  * See `PR 124 <https://github.com/gadventures/gapipy/pull/124>`_.
* Add ``variation_id`` field to the ``Image`` resource.
  * See `Commit edc8d9b <https://github.com/gadventures/gapipy/commit/edc8d9b>`_.
* Update the ``ActivityDossier`` and ``AccommodationDossier`` resources.
  * Remove the ``is_prepaid`` field.
  * Adds the ``has_costs`` field.
  * See `Commit bd35531 <https://github.com/gadventures/gapipy/commit/bd35531>`_.

.. _`Issue #113`: https://github.com/gadventures/gapipy/issues/113


2.26.0 (2020-04-14)
-------------------

**Breaking Changes**

* The ``Query.filter`` method will return a clone/copy of itself. This will
  preserve the state of ``filters`` on the original Query object.
* The ``Query.all`` method will **not** clear the filters after returning.
* The ``Query.all`` method will return a ``TypeError`` if a type other than
  an ``int`` is passed to the ``limit`` argument.
* The ``Query.count`` method will **not** clear the filters after returning.
* See `PR 121 <https://github.com/gadventures/gapipy/pull/121>`_

New behaviour with the ``Query.filter`` method:

.. code-block:: python

    >>> from gapipy import Client
    >>> api = Client(application_key='MY_SECRET_KEY')

    # create a filter on the departures
    >>> query = api.departures.filter(**{"tour_dossier.id": "24309"})
    >>> query.count()
    494

    # we preserve the filter status of the current query
    >>> query.filter(**{"availability.status": "AVAILABLE"}).count()
    80

    >>> query.count()
    494

* The ``AgencyChain.agencies`` attribute returns a list of ``Agency`` objects
  * See `Commit f34afd52 <https://github.com/gadventures/gapipy/commit/f34afd52>`_


2.25.1 (2020-01-02)
-------------------

* Improve contribution instructions to check long_description rST file in dist
* Dev Requirement updates:
  * Add ``readme_renderer==24.0``
  * Add ``twine==1.15.0`` for ``twine check`` command


2.25.0 (2020-01-02)
-------------------

* Failing to fetch inlined Resource (from Stubs) will raise the underlying
  requests.HTTPError instead of AttributeError resulting from a ``None``.
* Adds ``httperrors_mapped_to_none`` kwarg to ``gapipy.query.Query.get``
  with default value ``gapipy.query.HTTPERRORS_MAPPED_TO_NONE``
* Modifies ``gapipy.resources.base.Resource.fetch`` to
  pass ``httperrors_mapped_to_none=None`` to ``Query.get``
* This ensures that any underlying ``requests.HTTPError`` from ``Query.get``
  is bubbled up to the caller. It is most prevalent when reference Resource stubs
  fail to be retrieved from the G API. Prior to this change ``Resource.fetch``
  would return a ``None`` value resulting in an ``AttributeError``. Now, if the
  stub fails to fetch due to an HTTPError, that will be raised instead


2.24.3 (2019-12-12)
-------------------

* Exclude the ``tests`` package from the package distribution


2.24.2 (2019-12-12)
-------------------

* Add ``continent`` and ``place`` references to the ``Countries`` resource
  * See https://github.com/gadventures/gapipy/pull/115
* Accept ``additional_headers`` optional kwarg on ``create``
  * See https://github.com/gadventures/gapipy/pull/114


2.23.0 (2019-11-04)

  of ``RequirementSet`` resources
* see https://github.com/gadventures/gapipy/releases/tag/2.20.0 for more details


2.19.4 (2019-02-14)
-------------------

* Add ``valid_during_ranges`` list field to the Itinerary resource. This field is
  a list field of the newly added ``ValidDuringRange`` model (described below)
* Add ``ValidDuringRange`` model. It consists of two date fields, ``start_date``,
  and ``end_date``. It also provides a number of convenience methods to determine
  if the date range provided is valid, or relative to some date.

  * ``is_expired``: Is it expired relative to ``datetime.date.today`` (occurs in the past)
  * ``is_valid_today``: Is it valid relative to ``datetime.date.today``

* Moved ``resources/bookings/nationality.py`` to ``resources/geo/*``


2.14.6 (2018-08-01)
-------------------

------------------

* Add new fields to the ``Agency`` and ``AgencyChain`` resources


2.8.0 (2017-10-23)
------------------

* This release adds a behaviour change to the ``.all()`` method on resource
  Query objects. Prior to this release, the base Resource Query object would
  retain any previously added ``filter`` values, and be used in subsequent
  calls. Now the underlying filters are reset after a ``<resource>.all()`` call
  is made.

------------------

* Removed invalid field, ``email`` from ``AgencyChain``

2.1.0 (2016-04-25)
------------------

* Added new resource, ``AgencyChain``

2.0.0 (2016-03-11)
------------------

The global reference to the last instantiated Client has been removed. It is
now mandatory to pass in a Client instance when instantiating a Model or
Resource.

In practice, this should not introduce too much changes in codebases that are
using ``gapipy``, since resources are mostly interacted with through a Client
instance (for example, ``api.tours.get(123)``, or
``api.customers.create({...})``), instead of being instantiated independently.
The one possible exception is unit testing: in that case, ``Client.build`` can
be useful.

The global variable was causing issues with connection pooling when multiple
client with different configurations were used at the same time.

1.1.0 (2016-03-11)
------------------

* Added new resource, ``DossierFeature``

1.0.0 (2016-02-29)
------------------

* Adopted `Semantic Versioning <http://semver.org/>`_ for this project.
* Refactored how the cache key is set. This is a breaking change for any
  modules that implemented their own cache interface. The cache modules are
  no longer responsible for defining the cache value, but simply storing
  whatever it is given into cache. The ``Query`` object now introduces a
  ``query_key`` function which generates the cache key sent to the cache
  modules.

0.6.3 (2016-01-21)
------------------

* Added better error handling to `Client.build`. An AttributeError raised when
  instantiating a resource won't be shadowed by the except block anymore.


0.6.2 (2016-01-20)
------------------

* Fixed a regression bug when initializing DepartureServiceRoom model.

0.6.1 (2016-01-20)
------------------

------------------

* Added ``name`` to ``Departure``.

0.5.2 (2015-12-15)
------------------

* Added ``variation_id`` to ``BaseCache`` to fix a ``TypeError`` when using
  the ``NullCache``

0.5.1 (2015-12-14)
------------------

* Add ``associated_agency`` to ``bookings`` resource

0.5.0 (2015-12-10)
------------------

* Minor adjusted in Query internals to ensure the ``variation_id`` of an
  Itinerary is handled properly.
* Added ``ItineraryHighlights`` and ``ItineraryMedia`` resources. These are
  sub resources of the ``Itinerary``

0.4.6 (2015-12-09)
------------------

* Added connection pool caching to ``RedisCache``. Instances of ``gapipy`` with
  the same cache settings (in the same Python process) will share a connection
  pool.

0.4.5 (2015-11-05)
------------------

* Added ``code`` field to the ``type`` of an ``Itinerary``'s listed
  ``details``.

0.4.4 (2015-11-04)
------------------

* Added the ``details`` field to the ``Itinerary`` resource -- a list of
  textual details about an itinerary.

0.4.3 (2015-11-03)
-------------------

* Added the ``tour_dossier`` field to the ``Itinerary`` resource.

0.4.2 (2015-10-28)
------------------

* Fixed a bug that would cause ``amount`` when looking at ``Promotion`` objects
  in the ``Departure`` to be removed from the data dict.

0.4.1 (2015-10-16)
------------------

* Moved an import of ``requests`` down from the module level. Fixes issues in
  CI environments.

0.4.0 (2015-10-13)
------------------

* Added connection pooling options, see docs for details on
  ``connection_pool_options``.

0.3.0 (2015-09-24)
------------------

* Modified how the ``Promotion`` object is loaded within ``price_bands`` on a
  ``Departure``. It now correctly captures the ``amount`` field.

0.2.0 (2015-09-15)
------------------

* Modified objects within ``cache`` module to handle ``variation_id``, which is
  exposed within the ``Itinerary`` object. Previously, the ``Itinerary`` would
  not be correctly stored in cache with its variant reference.

0.1.51 (2015-08-31)
-------------------

* Added the ``components`` field to the ``Departure`` resource.


0.1.50 (2015-07-28)
-------------------

* Fixed an issue with the default ``gapipy.cache.NullCache`` when ``is_cached``
  was used.

0.1.49 (2015-07-23)
-------------------

* Added new fields to ``Itinerary`` revolving around variations.
* Added ``declined_reason`` to all service resources.

0.1.48 (2015-07-15)
-------------------

* Add DeclinedReason resource

0.1.47 (2015-07-08)
-------------------

* Fixed a bug in ``APIRequestor.get``. Requesting a resource with with an id of
  ``0`` won't raise an Exception anymore.

0.1.46 (2015-06-10)
-------------------

* Added ``associated_services`` and ``original_departure_service`` to various
  service resources and ``departure_services`` model respectively.

0.1.45 (2015-05-27)
-------------------

* Fixed ``products`` within the ``Promotion`` resource to properly retain
  ``type`` and ``sub_type`` fields after being parsed into a dictionary.

0.1.44 (2015-05-22)
-------------------

* Changed default `cache_backend` to use `gapipy.cache.NullCache`. Previously,
  `SimpleCache` was the default and led to confusion in production
  environments, specifically as to why resources were not matching the API
  output. Now, by default, to get any caching from gapipy you must explicitly
  set it.

0.1.43 (2015-04-29)
-------------------

* Fixed `Place` init with empty admin_divisions


0.1.42 (2015-04-29)

-------------------

* Added `deposit` to `DepartureService` model

0.1.39 (2015-03-31)

  functionality, it is now possible to override specific methods on
  ``APIRequestor`` if needed.


0.1.38 (2015-03-23)
-------------------

* Fixed: Due to inconsistencies in the G API with regards to nested resources,
  the `fetch` function was modified to use the raw data from the API, rather
  than a specific set of allowed fields.

0.1.37 (2015-03-23)
-------------------

* Fixed: Iterating over ``products`` within the ``promotions`` object now works
  as expected. Previously, accessing the ``products`` attribute would result in
  a Query object with incorrect parameters.

0.1.36 (2015-03-17)
-------------------

* Support free to amount price range formatting (e.g. Free-10CAD)

0.1.35 (2015-03-12)

-------------------

* The reference to the itinerary in a ``DepartureService`` is now a
  full-fledged ``Itinerary`` resource.

0.1.28 (2015-01-22)
-------------------

-------------------

  gapipy would query for all promotions, rather than returning the inline list.

0.1.20 (2014-11-20)
-------------------

* Departure resource is now listable via filters.

0.1.19 (2014-11-17)
-------------------

* Fixed a bug with `RedisCache.is_cached` where it would not use the set
  `key_prefix` when checking for existence in cache. Effectively, it would
  always return False

0.1.18 (2014-11-12)
-------------------

* When setting a date_field, initiate it as a `datetime.date` type.

0.1.17 (2014-11-07)
-------------------

  well tested or reliable.

  value.

  time.

0.1.11 (2014-10-15)
---------------------

* Improve the performance of ``Resource.fetch`` by handling cache get/set.

  correct PATCH HTTP method will be sent with the request.

------------------

* Return ``None`` instead of raising a HTTPError 404 exception when fetching a
  non-existing resource by id.

  instance.
  e.g.:
